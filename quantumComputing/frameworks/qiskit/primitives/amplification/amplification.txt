amplification is what we use to change our unreadable phase differences into readable magnitude differences.

>> If we have three possible states for a 4 qubit register. These three states are spread across a 16 feature map, giving us a 3 x 16 matrix of values. 

First create a 3 x 16 matrix in numpy or python, and load them into pandas.
