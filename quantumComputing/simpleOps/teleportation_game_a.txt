The object of the teleportation game is to teleport a state to a friend

In order to teleport information, we have to build the following circuit:
3 qubits
a hadamard and a cnot
2 hadamards and a phase
a single cnot
a final hadamard 
2 readouts

0. initialize all qubits to state 0
1. add hadamard to qubit 2, and a cnot on qubit 2 to 3.
2. prep payload with a had | rotate | had on qubit 1
3. add a cnot on qubit 1 to 2.
4. add a had on qubit 1.
