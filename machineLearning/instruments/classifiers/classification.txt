classification is the means by which we will able to predict categories for data or images.

Let us first construct a dummy data set. 
- Create a csv file, with 9 rows, and 5 columns.
- an example would be an touch_count, dribble_count, pass_count, ppm. 
- - we could use a classifier to predict if the person would be an all star.
